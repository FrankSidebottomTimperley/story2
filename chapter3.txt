Some guys thought Hendrix was the best. Others thought Clapton was. They resolved it by forming two sides and meeting in the biggest pub in the town. Both legions faced the other from either sides of the pub. They then, after the landlord blew his whistle, charge each other with broken ale bottles. It was a full frontal attack of facial glassings. The team that had the last standing man was the winner. The blood flowed out into the street, but none a face was less ugly than beginning.
